## Street Safety System 🚦

## 📌 Overview
The **Street Safety System** is a project aimed at addressing issues related to **street safety**.  
While applications like Google Maps provide some information, they often lack detailed insights into how safe a particular street really is.  

This project focuses on providing users with a **safety-oriented map interface** that highlights:
- How safe a street is (safety ratings).
- Hazards and potential problems at specific locations.
- Helpful insights to make informed travel decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Provide **detailed street-level safety information**.
  
- Display **hazards, problems, or risks** at specific locations.
  
- Help users choose **safer routes** for travel.
